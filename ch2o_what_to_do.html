<h3>What To Do</h3>
<p>Indoor formaldehyde levels can also be reduced by ensuring adequate ventilation, using your stove vent fan, and maintaining moderate temperatures and reduced humidity levels through the use of air conditioners and dehumidifiers. Do not smoke indoors.</p>

<p>Use certified products containing low amounts of formaldehyde and that minimize off-gassing. Before buying  manufactured wood products, including building materials, cabinetry, and furniture, ask about the formaldehyde content of these products.</p>

<p>Formaldehyde exposure from personal care products and cosmetics can be reduced by not using products that contain or release it. Formaldehyde-containing products listed on a product label include:
<ul>
<li>Formalin</li>
<li>Formic aldehyde</li>
<li>Methanediol</li>
<li>Methanal</li>
<li>Methyl aldehyde</li>
<li>Methylene glycol</li>
<li>Methylene oxide</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Some chemicals that are used as preservatives can release formaldehyde, such as:
<ul>
<li>Benzylhemiformal</li>
<li>2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol</li>
<li>5-bromo-5-nitro-1,3-dioxane</li>
<li>Diazolidinyl urea</li>
<li>Imidazolidinyl urea</li>
<li>1,3-dimethylol-5, 5-dimethylhydantoin (or DMDM hydantoin)</li>
<li>Sodium hydroxymethylglycinate</li>
<li>Quaternium-15</li>
<ul>
