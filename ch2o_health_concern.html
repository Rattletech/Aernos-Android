<h3>Health Concern</h3>
<p>Exposure most commonly happens by breathing air containing formaldehyde that has off-gassed from common household products.</p>

<p>Some people are very sensitive to formaldehyde while others have no reaction at the same level of exposure. Formaldehyde can cause symptoms including:
<ul>
<li>watery eyes</li>
<li>burning sensations of the eyes, nose, and throat</li>
<li>coughing</li>
<li>wheezing</li>
<li>nausea</li>
<li>skin irritation</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Formaldehyde in consumer products such as cosmetics and lotions can cause an allergic reaction in the skin (allergic contact dermatitis), which can lead to an itchy, red rash which may become raised or develop blisters.</p>
