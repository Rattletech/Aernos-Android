<h3>What Is It</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde (CH<sub>2</sub>O) is a colorless gas at room temperature. It has a strong, pungent odor.</p>

<p>Formaldehyde is a natural chemical found in the environment. Humans and most other living organisms make small amounts as part of normal metabolic processes.</p>

<p>Formaldehyde is used in manufactured wood products, such as:
<ul>
<li>particleboard</li>
<li>plywood</li>
<li>fiberboard</li>
<li>glues and adhesives</li>
<li>permanent-press fabrics</li>
<li>paper product coatings</li>
<li>insulation materials</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Within a few hours, formaldehyde breaks down in the air. It is called formalin when dissolved in water, which is commonly used as an industrial disinfectant and as a medical preservative. It is also used to make other chemicals, such as food preservatives, antiseptics, medicines, and cosmetics.</p>

<p>Sometimes, although formaldehyde is not used, substances that release formaldehyde are used in manufacturing. These substances are used in cosmetics, soaps, shampoos, lotions and sunscreens, and cleaning products.</p>

<p>Formaldehyde can be added as a preservative to food, but it can also be produced as the result of cooking and smoking.</p>
