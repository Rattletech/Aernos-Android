<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde is a natural chemical made in the body and released during breathing. It is also released as a  gas into the air from materials containing it. Automobile exhaust is a major source of formaldehyde in outdoor air.</p>

<p>Manufactured wood products containing formaldehyde resins are a common source of formaldehyde in homes. Using unvented fuel-burning appliances, such as gas stoves, wood-burning stoves, and kerosene heaters can also raise formaldehyde levels indoors.</p>

<p>Formaldehyde is also a component of tobacco smoke and both smokers and those breathing secondhand smoke are exposed to higher levels of formaldehyde.</p>

<p>Formaldehyde and other chemicals that release formaldehyde are sometimes used in low concentrations in cosmetics and other personal care products like lotions, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and some fingernail polishes. These may raise the concentration of formaldehyde in the air inside the room for a short time, but the levels reached are far below what is considered to be hazardous. Professional keratin hair smoothing treatments can contain formaldehyde or formaldehyde releasing chemicals.</p>
